Experiments on Game UI using C++

## Classical game flow

This is an experiment (currently in `poc.cpp`) to replicate a classical screen
flow in video games: two splash screens, main menu, some options and credits.

Due to lack of imagination (or maybe excess of it) one of the splash screens is
a 512x512 classical image named [Lenna][lenna]. This is a copyrighted image not
covered by the MIT license of this code. Therefore, if you want to use this
project as-is, you need to deal with it.

File whose name start with `m3-` are assets coming from [this Itch.io
pack][match3] created by DevilWork.shop.
